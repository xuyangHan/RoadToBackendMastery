   var client = new ElasticClient(settings);
   ```

   Replace `http://localhost:9200` with the URL of your Elasticsearch instance.

### **Basic Operations in Elasticsearch**

Here are some basic operations you can perform using the NEST client:

1. **Indexing Logs**  
   Add log entries to Elasticsearch:

   ```csharp
   var log = new { Timestamp = DateTime.UtcNow, Level = "Info", Message = "Application started" };
   var response = client.IndexDocument(log);
   ```

2. **Searching Logs**  
   Retrieve logs containing specific terms:

   ```csharp
   var searchResponse = client.Search<dynamic>(s => s
       .Query(q => q.Match(m => m.Field("Message").Query("started"))));
   ```

   Iterate through the search results:

   ```csharp
   foreach (var hit in searchResponse.Hits)
   {
       Console.WriteLine(hit.Source);
   }
   ```

3. **Deleting Logs**

               .Field("timestamp")
               .GreaterThanOrEquals("now-1d")
               .LessThanOrEquals("now")
           )
       )
   );
   ```

2. **Search Logs by Log Level**  
   Retrieve all logs with the error level:

   ```csharp
   var levelQueryResponse = client.Search<dynamic>(s => s
       .Query(q => q.Match(m => m.Field("level").Query("Error"))));
   ```

       )
   );

   var logLevels = aggregationResponse.Aggregations.Terms("log_levels");
   foreach (var bucket in logLevels.Buckets)
   {
       Console.WriteLine($"Level: {bucket.Key}, Count: {bucket.DocCount}");
   }
   ```

2. **Analyze Logs Over Time**  
   Group logs by hourly intervals:

   ```csharp
   var timeAggregationResponse = client.Search<dynamic>(s => s
       .Aggregations(a => a
           .DateHistogram("logs_over_time", h => h
               .Field("timestamp")
               .CalendarInterval(DateInterval.Hour)
           )
       )
   );

   var buckets = timeAggregationResponse.Aggregations.DateHistogram("logs_over_time").Buckets;
   foreach (var bucket in buckets)
   {
       Console.WriteLine($"Time: {bucket.KeyAsString}, Count: {bucket.DocCount}");
   }
   ```
