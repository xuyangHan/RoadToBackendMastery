# Mastering Creational Patterns in C#: Singleton and Factory Method

When developing complex C# applications, managing object creation can become challenging. Creational design patterns provide structured solutions to control and manage the object creation process, making code more flexible, maintainable, and scalable. In this two-part series, we’ll dive into creational patterns, starting with two foundational patterns: **Singleton** and **Factory Method**.

Before diving into creational design patterns, it's recommended to have a solid grasp of key object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in C#. In our previous articles, we covered foundational topics like interfaces, abstract classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. These concepts are crucial for understanding the examples in this article. If you encounter difficulties with the code or concepts presented here, we strongly encourage revisiting the foundational guides.

## **Common Challenges in Object Creation**

In large systems, directly creating objects with constructors may lead to the following problems:

- **Tight Coupling**: Code becomes dependent on specific classes, reducing flexibility.
- **Lack of Flexibility**: Changing how objects are created requires modifying a lot of code.
- **Code Duplication**: Similar object creation logic may be repeated in multiple places.

Creational patterns solve these problems by separating object creation logic from the application’s core logic, thereby enhancing code flexibility and reusability.

---

## **Overview of Creational Patterns**

Creational patterns abstract the process of object creation, decoupling client code from the actual instantiation logic. Common creational patterns include:

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
- **Abstract Factory**: Provides an interface for creating related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Constructs a complex object step by step.
- **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying existing ones (prototypes).

In this article, we’ll focus on **Singleton** and **Factory Method**.

## **Singleton Pattern**

### **What Is the Singleton Pattern?**

The **Singleton Pattern** ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. It’s particularly useful for managing shared resources like logging services, configuration settings, or database connections.

### **What Problem Does It Solve?**

In many applications, ensuring a single instance of a class is critical. For example, multiple instances of a database connection or logging service could lead to unnecessary resource consumption or inconsistent states. The Singleton Pattern provides a mechanism to ensure a single instance and global accessibility.

### **Using Generics to Implement the Singleton Pattern in C#**

Using a generic `Singleton<T>` class simplifies the implementation of the Singleton Pattern. By inheriting `Singleton<T>`, any class can easily become a singleton without rewriting the singleton logic.

Here’s an example of implementing a singleton using generics:

```csharp
public abstract class Singleton<T> where T : class
{
    private static T _instance = null;
    private static readonly object _lock = new object();

    // Returns the single instance of the class, creating it if necessary
    public static T Instance
    {
        get
        {
            lock (_lock)
            {
                if (_instance == null)
                {
                    _instance = Activator.CreateInstance(typeof(T), true) as T;
                }
                return _instance;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Now, you can create a singleton class by inheriting `Singleton<T>`:

### **Example: Logging Service as a Singleton**

```csharp
public class LoggingService : Singleton<LoggingService>
{
    // Private constructor prevents direct instantiation
    private LoggingService() { }

    public void Log(string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Log Entry: " + message);
    }
}

// Usage
LoggingService.Instance.Log("This is a log message.");
```

### **When to Use the Singleton Pattern**

- **Resource Management**: When you need to control access to shared resources (e.g., logging, configuration, database connections) and ensure a single instance exists.
- **Global State**: To manage application-wide settings or services, especially when multiple instances could lead to inconsistencies.
- **Caching**: To cache globally accessible data and avoid recreating it unnecessarily.

### **Common Pitfalls of the Singleton Pattern**

- **Overuse**: Improper use of singletons can introduce hidden dependencies, making code harder to test.
- **Thread Safety**: In multithreaded environments, improper handling of singleton instances may lead to race conditions.

### **Advantages of Generic Singleton Implementation**

- **Reusability**: Singleton logic is encapsulated in the `Singleton<T>` class and can be reused across different classes.
- **Reduced Boilerplate Code**: No need to rewrite singleton logic for every class that follows the Singleton Pattern.
- **Flexibility**: By using generics, any class type can enforce singleton behavior without additional code.

### **Singleton Pattern vs. Static Class**

Although **Singleton** and **Static Class** both provide a mechanism for single access points to shared resources, their purposes differ:

- **Singleton** is instance-based, allowing for lazy initialization and lifecycle control. It can implement interfaces, inherit other classes, and manage object behavior. This makes it ideal for managing shared resources like database connections or logging services.
  
- **Static Class** is class-scoped, cannot be instantiated, and has all members static. It’s primarily used for utility functions or helper methods, lacking the flexibility and lifecycle management capabilities of a singleton.

In summary, choose **Singleton** when you need more control over the lifecycle and behavior of a single instance. Opt for **Static Class** when you need simple, reusable methods without managing state.

## **Factory Method Pattern**

### **What Is the Factory Method Pattern?**

The **Factory Method Pattern** provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. Instead, subclasses decide which class to instantiate. This enables flexible object creation based on runtime conditions.

### **What Problem Does It Solve?**

When a system needs to create objects but doesn’t know in advance which class to instantiate, directly using constructors tightly couples the client code with specific implementations. The Factory Method abstracts the object creation process, allowing different types of objects to be created flexibly.

### **How to Implement the Factory Method Pattern in C#**

Below is an implementation of the Factory Method pattern:

```csharp
// Product interface
public interface IAnimal
{
    string Speak();
}

// Concrete products
public class Dog : IAnimal
{
    public string Speak() => "Woof!";
}

public class Cat : IAnimal
{
    public string Speak() => "Meow!";
}

// Creator class with a factory method
public abstract class AnimalFactory
{
    public abstract IAnimal CreateAnimal();
}

// Concrete creator classes
public class DogFactory : AnimalFactory
{
    public override IAnimal CreateAnimal() => new Dog();
}

public class CatFactory : AnimalFactory
{
    public override IAnimal CreateAnimal() => new Cat();
}
```

The key component here is the **`AnimalFactory`** class, which defines the **factory method** (`CreateAnimal()`), returning an interface (**`IAnimal`**) instead of a concrete class. This provides flexibility for creating different types of animals (e.g., `Dog`, `Cat`). The Factory Method pattern is especially useful in the Business Logic Layer (BLL) as it allows object creation without specifying the exact classes, adhering to the Open-Closed Principle.

### **Example: How the Factory Method Helps the Business Logic Layer (BLL)**

Suppose we have a **PetService** class that manages pets. Without the Factory Method, the code might need to know all possible animal types (like Dog, Cat, etc.), leading to tight coupling. By using the Factory Method, we can decouple the pet creation logic from the business logic.

#### Example: Without the Factory Method

```csharp
public class PetService
{
    public string GetPetSound(string petType)
    {
        if (petType == "Dog")
        {
            var dog = new Dog();
            return dog.Speak();
        }
        else if (petType == "Cat")
        {
            var cat = new Cat();
            return cat.Speak();
        }

        throw new Exception("Unknown pet type.");
    }
}
```

This approach tightly couples the **PetService** class with the specific pet classes. Adding new pet types makes the code harder to maintain.

#### Example: Using the Factory Method

With the Factory Method, the **PetService** class doesn’t need to know about specific classes:

```csharp
public class PetService
{
    private readonly AnimalFactory _animalFactory;

    public PetService(AnimalFactory animalFactory)
    {
        _animalFactory = animalFactory;
    }

    public string GetPetSound()
    {
        var animal = _animalFactory.CreateAnimal();
        return animal.Speak();
    }
}
```

Now, you can instantiate `PetService` using different `AnimalFactory` implementations:

```csharp
var dogService = new PetService(new DogFactory());
Console.WriteLine(dogService.GetPetSound());  // Output: Woof!

var catService = new PetService(new CatFactory());
Console.WriteLine(catService.GetPetSound());  // Output: Meow!
```

### **Benefits in the Business Logic Layer (BLL)**

1. **Scalability**: Adding a new animal type (e.g., `Bird`) only requires creating a new factory (`BirdFactory`) and concrete product (`Bird`), without modifying the **PetService** code.
2. **Separation of Concerns**: **PetService** focuses on business logic (retrieving pet sounds) without worrying about the details of object creation.
3. **Testability**: It’s easier to mock **AnimalFactory** in unit tests, allowing better control over the type of object created during testing.

This approach provides a flexible, maintainable, and scalable solution for the business logic layer by leveraging the Factory Method pattern.

---

### **When to Use the Factory Method**

- **Decoupling Object Creation from Business Logic**: When your system needs to create objects but you want to decouple the creation logic from the rest of the application.
- **Frequent Addition of New Types**: In systems where new object types are frequently added, the Factory Method is beneficial as it avoids modifying existing code when introducing new classes.

---

### **Common Pitfalls of the Factory Method**

- **Complexity**: Overusing the Factory Method can lead to unnecessary complexity by creating too many subclasses.
- **Misuse**: Sometimes, simpler methods like direct instantiation are sufficient, especially when the logic doesn’t require flexibility.
