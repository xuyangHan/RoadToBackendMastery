# Mastering Dependency Injection in C#: From Basics to Redis-Powered Caching

## üß© Introduction: Why Dependency Injection Matters

Dependency Injection (DI) is more than just a buzzword ‚Äî it's a fundamental design pattern that helps build **modular, testable, and maintainable software**. By inverting the control of how dependencies are created and delivered, DI decouples classes from their concrete implementations.

Why does this matter in real-world applications?

* It reduces duplication of logic and instances.
* It allows easy swapping of implementations (e.g., from an in-memory cache to Redis).
* It makes unit testing a breeze ‚Äî no need to spin up the entire system.

In this post, we‚Äôll walk through how DI works in C#, starting with the "bad old way," then move into a clean, flexible design using DI. We‚Äôll finish with a real-world use case: caching with Redis.

## üö´ The Naive Approach: Without Dependency Injection

Let‚Äôs say we‚Äôre building a simple user registration feature, and we need to send welcome emails. A typical, tightly-coupled implementation might look like this:

```csharp
public class EmailService
{
    public void Send(string to, string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sending email to {to}: {message}");
    }
}

public class UserController
{
    private EmailService _emailService = new EmailService(); // tightly coupled

    public void RegisterUser(string email)
    {
        // Register the user...
        _emailService.Send(email, "Welcome!");
    }
}
```

### üîç What's the problem here?

* **Tight coupling**: `UserController` directly controls the creation of `EmailService`.
* **Duplication**: Every controller or service that needs email functionality creates its own instance.
* **Hard to test**: Want to test `UserController` without sending real emails? Good luck stubbing or mocking this setup.
* **Inflexibility**: What if we want to swap `EmailService` with an external API provider? You‚Äôre stuck refactoring everywhere.

---

## ‚úÖ Refactored with Dependency Injection

Let‚Äôs clean things up using **constructor injection**, the most common DI technique in C#.

```csharp
public class EmailService
{
    public void Send(string to, string message)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Sending email to {to}: {message}");
    }
}

public class UserController
{
    private readonly EmailService _emailService;

    public UserController(EmailService emailService)
    {
        _emailService = emailService;
    }

    public void RegisterUser(string email)
    {
        _emailService.Send(email, "Welcome!");
    }
}
```

We now let an external system (usually a DI container) provide the `EmailService`. This allows for:

* **Reusability**: One shared `EmailService` can be reused across controllers.
* **Testability**: Easily inject a mock email service during testing.
* **Flexibility**: Swap the service implementation at runtime without touching `UserController`.

In an ASP.NET Core app, registering dependencies in `Startup.cs` looks like this:

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<EmailService>();
services.AddTransient<UserController>();
```

Every `UserController` gets a new instance, but they all share the same `EmailService` instance (because it's registered as a singleton).

In the next section, we‚Äôll take this concept further by exploring how DI gives you the **flexibility to switch between local memory and distributed Redis caching**, all without changing your core logic.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Real-World Use Case: Caching with Redis vs. Local Memory

In real-world applications, caching is essential for performance and scalability. Whether it's user sessions, product data, or API results ‚Äî caching can dramatically reduce load times and system strain.

But here's the challenge:
**How do you design your system so you can easily switch between a local memory cache (good for dev or simple apps) and a distributed cache like Redis (needed in production)?**

The answer? **Dependency Injection + Interfaces.**

---

### üß± Step 1: Define a Cache Interface

We start by abstracting the caching logic with an interface:

```csharp
public interface ICacheService
{
    Task<string> GetAsync(string key);
    Task SetAsync(string key, string value);
}
```

---

### üöÄ Step 2: Implement Local Memory Cache

```csharp
public class InMemoryCacheService : ICacheService
{
    private readonly Dictionary<string, string> _cache = new();

    public Task<string> GetAsync(string key)
    {
        _cache.TryGetValue(key, out var value);
        return Task.FromResult(value);
    }

    public Task SetAsync(string key, string value)
    {
        _cache[key] = value;
        return Task.CompletedTask;
    }
}
```

---

### üåê Step 3: Implement Redis Cache

```csharp
public class RedisCacheService : ICacheService
{
    private readonly IDatabase _redis;

    public RedisCacheService(IConnectionMultiplexer redis)
    {
        _redis = redis.GetDatabase();
    }

    public async Task<string> GetAsync(string key)
    {
        return await _redis.StringGetAsync(key);
    }

    public async Task SetAsync(string key, string value)
    {
        await _redis.StringSetAsync(key, value, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30));
    }
}
```

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Step 4: Register Based on Environment

With DI, you can **dynamically choose the cache implementation** based on environment:

```csharp
if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
    services.AddSingleton<ICacheService, InMemoryCacheService>();
}
else
{
    services.AddSingleton<IConnectionMultiplexer>(
        ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect("localhost:6379"));
    services.AddSingleton<ICacheService, RedisCacheService>();
}
```

Now any controller or service can request `ICacheService`, and it will **automatically get the right implementation** based on the runtime environment.

---

### üß™ Bonus: Using It in a Controller

```csharp
public class ProductController
{
    private readonly ICacheService _cache;

    public ProductController(ICacheService cache)
    {
        _cache = cache;
    }

    public async Task<string> GetProduct(string productId)
    {
        var cached = await _cache.GetAsync(productId);
        if (cached != null)
            return $"From cache: {cached}";

        // Simulate database fetch
        string productData = $"Product_{productId}_Details";
        await _cache.SetAsync(productId, productData);

        return $"From DB: {productData}";
    }
}
```

> With zero changes to `ProductController`, you can now switch between local and Redis cache simply by changing your DI registration.

## üß† Why Redis + DI is So Powerful

* Redis is a **distributed, in-memory key-value store** ‚Äî perfect for applications that need to share data across multiple servers or containers.
* Using DI ensures **your application logic remains agnostic** to the caching mechanism.
* You can swap out cache implementations at runtime without modifying any core logic or business code.
* DI helps manage Redis connections (via `IConnectionMultiplexer`) as singletons, ensuring efficient resource usage.

---

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

Dependency Injection is more than just a code organization tool ‚Äî it‚Äôs a cornerstone of **scalable, flexible, and testable** application architecture.

By using DI:

* You avoid unnecessary instance duplication.
* You enable seamless testing and mocking.
* You gain the flexibility to switch between implementations (e.g., Redis vs. memory cache) without rewriting your logic.

And when paired with a system like Redis, DI allows you to **scale horizontally, cache intelligently, and maintain clean boundaries** in your application code.
