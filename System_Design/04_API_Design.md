# API Design: Building Bridges Between Systems

## Introduction

In modern software systems, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) play a central role in connecting different components, enabling communication between services, and providing a seamless experience for users. Whether it's a mobile app fetching data from a backend server or a third-party service integrating with your platform, a well-designed API ensures reliability, scalability, and ease of use.

For system design interviews, understanding API design is crucial. It's not just about defining endpoints—it's about creating robust, secure, and scalable interfaces that align with both business and technical requirements. In this post, we'll explore different types of APIs, their pros and cons, and best practices to guide your design choices.

## By Types of APIs

APIs come in various flavors, each with its strengths and trade-offs. Selecting the right type of API depends on the specific use case, scalability needs, and the ecosystem in which it operates. Below, we provide a brief overview of popular API types and their characteristics:

| **API Type** | **Advantages**                                   | **Disadvantages**                          |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **REST**     | Simple, widely adopted, clear structure          | Can be verbose for complex data            |
| **JSON API** | Efficient payload, structured responses          | Complexity in adhering to standards        |
| **SOAP**     | Secure, transactional, formal structure          | Verbose, slower                            |
| **gRPC**     | Fast, supports streaming, lightweight            | Requires setup, less human-readable        |
| **GraphQL**  | Flexible, efficient queries                      | Complex to implement, potential security issues |

### Overview of Popular API Types

1. **REST (Representational State Transfer)**  
   REST is one of the most widely used API paradigms due to its simplicity and stateless nature. It leverages standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and is resource-oriented, making it easy to understand and adopt.

2. **JSON API**  
   JSON API is a standard for building APIs using JSON as the primary data exchange format. It provides conventions for structuring responses and relationships, improving consistency across APIs.

3. **SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)**  
   SOAP is a protocol-based API type that supports transactional and secure communication. Although it's considered verbose and slower compared to REST, it's still widely used in industries requiring strict compliance, such as banking and healthcare.

4. **gRPC**  
   gRPC, a high-performance RPC framework developed by Google, supports streaming and uses Protocol Buffers (Protobuf) for efficient serialization. It’s ideal for low-latency communication but may require more setup compared to REST.

5. **GraphQL**  
   GraphQL enables clients to request only the data they need, reducing over-fetching and under-fetching issues commonly seen in REST. While it offers great flexibility, it introduces challenges in implementation and potential security concerns.

## Key Concepts in API Design

### Versioning

Versioning is essential to maintain backward compatibility and allow iterative improvements to your API. It ensures existing users are not disrupted by changes while enabling innovation and feature expansion. Popular versioning strategies include using version numbers in URLs (e.g., `/v1/resource`) or headers.

For an in-depth discussion, refer to [this post on API Basics](../Roadmap_Backend/06_API_Basics.md).

### Pagination

Pagination helps in managing large datasets by breaking them into smaller, more manageable chunks. It is critical for performance optimization, especially in systems with extensive data.

Key approaches to pagination include:

- **Offset-based Pagination**: Requests data starting from a specific offset, typically using query parameters like `?offset=10&limit=20`. It’s simple but can lead to performance issues with large datasets.
- **Cursor-based Pagination**: Uses a pointer (cursor) to fetch the next set of results, improving performance and consistency in dynamic datasets.
- **Keyset Pagination**: Focuses on ordering by unique keys to ensure stable pagination results.

When implementing pagination, consider:

- Providing metadata such as `total_count` or `next_page`.
- Handling edge cases like empty datasets or invalid offsets.

### Security Best Practices

1. **Authentication and Authorization**  
   Secure APIs by implementing authentication mechanisms like OAuth, JWT, and API keys. Proper authorization ensures users access only the resources they are allowed to.

   Refer to [this post on API Basics](../Roadmap_Backend/06_API_Basics.md) and [this post on API Advanced](../Roadmap_Backend/07_API_Advanced.md) for detailed guidance.

2. **Rate Limiting and Throttling**  
   Protect your APIs from abuse by limiting the number of requests a client can make within a specific timeframe. This ensures fair usage and prevents service disruptions.

   More details are available in [Solving Database Overload in API-Driven Applications](../Industry_Experience/04_API_Optimization.md).

3. **Preventing Injection Attacks**  
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL and NoSQL injection.
   - Sanitize inputs to avoid XSS attacks.

4. **Using HTTPS and Secure API Gateways**  
   Ensure all communication is encrypted using HTTPS and consider using API gateways for additional security layers.

### Error Handling

Robust error handling enhances user experience and helps in debugging. Key practices include:

- Using standardized HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).
- Returning detailed error messages with unique error codes and actionable messages.
- Implementing global error handlers in your API framework.
- Logging all errors for analysis and monitoring purposes.

### Documentation

Comprehensive documentation helps developers understand and adopt your API effectively. Use tools like Swagger or Postman for auto-generating and sharing API documentation.
