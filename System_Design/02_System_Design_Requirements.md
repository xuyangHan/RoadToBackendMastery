# Understanding Design Requirements and Principles in System Design

Designing a scalable and maintainable system is not just about writing code—it's about making informed decisions based on the needs of the application and following proven principles to guide your approach. This involves understanding both the **requirements** of the system and the **principles** that ensure your design is clean, efficient, and future-proof.

In this post, we'll discuss the two fundamental types of requirements—functional and non-functional—and explore key principles like KISS, YAGNI, and SOLID that form the foundation of good system design. By understanding these concepts, you'll gain clarity on how to approach system design challenges and make thoughtful decisions.

## **Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements**

When designing a system, the first step is to gather and understand its requirements. These requirements fall into two categories: **functional** and **non-functional**.

### **Functional Requirements**

Functional requirements define what the system should do. They describe the features and behavior of the system from a user's perspective. These are typically tied to business needs and directly impact user functionality.

**Examples:**

- A user should be able to upload videos to the platform.
- Viewers should be able to watch and comment on videos.
- Administrators should have the ability to remove inappropriate content.

Functional requirements form the backbone of your system's purpose. Without them, the system fails to deliver its core value.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

Non-functional requirements define how the system should behave. These are often referred to as "quality attributes" and ensure the system meets performance, scalability, security, and other operational expectations.

**Examples:**

- **Scalability**: The system should handle over 1 million concurrent users without degradation in performance.
- **Availability**: Maintain a 99.99% uptime to minimize downtime for users.
- **Performance**: API responses should be returned within 200ms on average.
- **Security**: Protect user data and prevent unauthorized access through secure authentication mechanisms.
- **Maintainability**: Ensure the system can be updated and extended with minimal effort.

Non-functional requirements ensure that the system delivers a great experience and remains robust under different conditions. While functional requirements describe the "what," non-functional requirements address the "how."

### **Why Both Matter**

Both types of requirements are critical for designing a successful system. Neglecting functional requirements means the system won’t meet user needs, while ignoring non-functional requirements can lead to poor performance, security risks, or operational challenges. Balancing these requirements is a key skill for system designers.

## **Principles of Good System Design**

Once the requirements are understood, design principles help guide the implementation to ensure the system is efficient, maintainable, and scalable. Let’s discuss two fundamental principles in detail and briefly touch upon others.

### **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**

The KISS principle emphasizes simplicity in design and discourages unnecessary complexity. A simpler system is easier to build, understand, maintain, and scale.

**Why It Matters:**

- Complex systems are harder to debug and extend.
- Simplicity reduces the likelihood of introducing bugs and makes onboarding new developers easier.

**Example:**

Imagine designing a logging service for your application. Instead of building a custom logging system from scratch, you can integrate an existing solution like the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). This approach saves development time and ensures a robust, battle-tested logging solution without adding unnecessary complexity.

### **YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It)**

The YAGNI principle encourages developers to avoid building features or components that are not immediately needed. Premature optimization or over-engineering often leads to wasted effort and a bloated system.

**Why It Matters:**

- Building unnecessary features increases development time and complexity.
- It’s hard to predict future requirements accurately, and assumptions often turn out to be incorrect.

**Example:**
Suppose you’re building a video platform and only need basic user authentication. Instead of implementing a complex role-based access control (RBAC) system upfront, start with simple authentication. If and when advanced authorization becomes a requirement, it can be added without impacting the current system.

### **SOLID Principles**

The SOLID principles—Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion—are essential for designing clean, object-oriented systems. These principles ensure that your system is modular, extensible, and maintainable. For a detailed breakdown of SOLID principles, refer to [OOP_SOLID_Principles](../CSharp_OOP/02_OOP_SOLID.md).

### **CAP Theorem**

The CAP theorem states that in a distributed system, you can only achieve two out of three guarantees: **Consistency**, **Availability**, and **Partition Tolerance**. Understanding this trade-off helps in making informed decisions when designing distributed systems. For a detailed explanation, check out [System_Design_Principles](../Roadmap_Backend/13_System_Design_Principles.md).

### **DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)**

The DRY principle focuses on reducing duplication in code and design. By avoiding repetitive logic and structures, you ensure that your system is easier to maintain and less prone to errors.

**Why It Matters:**

- Duplicated code can lead to inconsistencies and makes the system harder to maintain.
- Changes in one part of the system should not require updates in multiple places.

**Example:**
Instead of writing separate validation logic for user input in multiple places, create a reusable utility function or library that can handle validation uniformly across the system.

### **Scalability and Maintainability**

When designing systems, always aim for scalability and maintainability. A scalable system can handle growth in users or data, while a maintainable system can be easily updated or extended over time.

**Best Practices:**

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Add more servers to handle increased traffic.
- **Modularity**: Break the system into smaller, self-contained components.
- **Documentation**: Ensure that your system design and codebase are well-documented to help current and future developers understand the architecture.

## **Conclusion**

Designing a robust system requires a balance between understanding requirements and applying sound design principles. Functional and non-functional requirements define the "what" and "how" of the system, while principles like KISS, YAGNI, DRY, and scalability provide a framework for creating clean, efficient, and maintainable architectures. By incorporating these concepts into your design process, you’ll be better equipped to build systems that not only meet current needs but can also adapt to future challenges.
